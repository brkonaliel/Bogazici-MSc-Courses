Please put CompLearning.m drawSphere.m generate.m and Plot.m in the same folder.

1) Run CompLearning, the process will end after one epoch, if a mean is stuck between two clusters please cut the process and re-run the file, this will
change the initial positions and a convergance will be observed eventually.

2) After convergence is observed, please run Plot to see the path of the means.

3) The plots are animated to see all clusters means etc. 

4) Plot.m is a infinite loop created for presentation of paths and means
